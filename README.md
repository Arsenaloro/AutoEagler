# AutoEagler
A tool to automaticly set up a localhost eaglerXbungee, aiming to provide an alternative to singleplayer for Eaglercraft

## Progress:
- ðŸŸ  Write setup.bat (Messy code, not complete :>)
- ðŸŸ  Write setup.sh (Same thing but worse xD)

# For Mojang:
This tool does **NOT** include any of the source code from Minecraft, MCP, or any other illegal/copyrighted resources, nor any info on how to get it.
